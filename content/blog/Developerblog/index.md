I just started a new Dev Blog, here on DevDojo i had a developer blog on Medium

But I wasn't posting enough on it

[link to blog](https://keltheceo.devdojo.com).

> I mostly blog when I want to data dump what Im learning so it's out in the world
> and out of my head. Really things like Docker things and Database shortcuts.
> I only have two so far, but will add more shortly.
