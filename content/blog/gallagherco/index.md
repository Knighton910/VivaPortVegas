###### Global Management Consulting

Gallagher and Co is an application I built using Fullstack 
MernStack | Reactjs | Nodejs | Express |
 MongoDB Cloud | Bootstrap | JWT - Json web tokens | Redux

I got inspiration for this watching Showtime House Of Lies,
I really like the show so i figured might as well get some
experience from it. 

I will be building out over time but it's mostly finished
I just want to flush it out. It has full security features 
such as log in and sign in using MongoDB Cloud.
